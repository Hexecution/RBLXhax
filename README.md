# rblxhax
A simple Roblox Lua injector.

## Usage
To ensure that the injector functions correctly, do not delete any files. Put your scripts in the "Scripts" folder if you want them to show up in the program.

## Disclaimer
I am not responsible for anything you do with this, use at your own risk.

## Is it a virus?
No, definitely not. You may get multiple virus warnings due to the nature of the program, as it injects into Roblox.

## Works?
The code is outdated(while it could be fixed), with little incentive to fix. Now a archive.
